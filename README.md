This is an mvp of an application that was destined to be a vacation planner.
Users input a location and the results page displays the top 5 trending restaurants for that area. It also displays the weather information.

Due to time and API access constraints, we (4) were unable to finish the application with our intended features.
Future developments would include hotel, flight, and nearby activities API integration to search and book those respective items.
